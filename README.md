A really stupid experiment in C++ and the Windows 32 API.

## but why

In early 2023, this gif came through one of my Discord channels.

When I saw it at the time I was bored from other class projects and immediately knew what I had to do. As any reasonable human being would do, I then went and immediately spent four hours learning the Win32 API for C++ to recreate this gif, like any sane human being would do.

Honestly, this is actually pretty terrible, but it's also my first ever project that utilizes the Windows API, and it does it in C++ as well. However, I believe in preserving my code, even if it's bad because then it can be learned from.

This was developed in Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10 in February 2023, and compiled using C++19. I'm hoping to one day get it running on Windows XP but I'm far too busy with other things at the time. It was still a pretty fun way to spend an afternoon though, and the reaction from my friends was priceless.
